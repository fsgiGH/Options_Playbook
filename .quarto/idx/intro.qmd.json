{"title":"Introduction","markdown":{"headingText":"Introduction","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nAfter quite a lot of less or more useless theory in the dialogues with AI tools, it is now finally the time for starting being operative.\n\nI will eventually keep here a space, on the top, for introducing the possibly useful theory, but the important thing now is to set up a systematic trading plan on options.\n\n## Tools\n\nI have learned how difficult it is to develop a good software for options analysis. The overall lesson is that I can eventually rely o AI tools for helping in specific construction of specialized tools within my platform, but I need to keep full control of the process and use my human brain for making the design and keeping control.\n\n### My own software\n\nThe idea and aim of this software construction is the following:\n\n1.  I need an alternative to both ToS and TWS. ToS is not free to use unless I adopt the trick of continuously renewing my guess subscription, every time with a new email address. In addition, ToS is not perfect: charts are incomplete, difficult to manage and it is not possible to compare strategies for making good choices. TWS on the other hand is a fuzzy environment where finding what you may need is almost impossible.\n\n2.  The tool, in its logic, can be constructed entirely in R, which was confirmed to be the best number crunching machine around, including a series of excellent libraries, starting from RQuantLib.\n\n3.  I need to remake the core logic of the library, starting from constructing meaningful and not just toy instrument classes (S3).\n\n4.  Then I need to involve AI again to build up a bridge to IBKR.\n\n5.  Once this is in place, I can start laying out a GUI with shiny, before eventually deciding to go for a tauri-Javascript integration, which would require again the support of AI.\n\n6.  All this should proceed as a **side hobby-like** activity while trading is established and becomes so smooth that requires to me few time a day.\n\n### In the absence\n\nIn the absence of my own perfect options software, I will use what I have:\n\n1.  For analysis, mainly the guest account on ToS. If it will be necessary to renew it from time to time I will do\n\n2.  For the real trading TWS, which offers the good IBKR commission structure and probably good tools for filling orders. Perhaps with the time I can also learn some tricks for using efficiently some of the present tools.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"intro.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table

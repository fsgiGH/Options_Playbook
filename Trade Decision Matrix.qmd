# The trade decision matrix

Before starting any trade we need to analyze the market and make our decisions concerning

-   Instruments to trade

-   Market conditions

-   Correct option strategy to apply.

## The instruments

## Market conditions

The most important factors to analyze when the market is decided are **market regime** (trend or range) and **volatility.**

1.  **Trend State**: Is it in a strong trend or choppy/range-bound? (Look at 20-50 day moving average slope and ADX).

2.  **Realized Volatility (RV)**: High or low relative to its own history?

3.  **Implied Volatility (IV) Percentile**: Is IV cheap (low percentile) or expensive (high percentile)?

4.  **Correlation Check**: How does it move relative to others? (This is for portfolio construction).
